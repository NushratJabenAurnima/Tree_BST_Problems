## Problem 1
**Write a program that will display child of each node of a BST (Write only the 
Function).**

 **INPUT: 50 20 70 10 45**

**OUTPUT:**

**Child of 50: 20 and 70**

**Child of 20: 10 and 45**

**Child of 10: NULL**

**Child of 45: NULL**

**Child of 70: NULL**





## Problem 4
**Write a program that will construct a BST, print the nodes who are sibling (child of same parent) in the BST and delete those nodes that are leaf and doesn't have any sibling.
First, your program will take inputs from the user and construct the BST, Second, it will print the tree elements using preorder traversal. Next, it will print the nodes who are sibling (child of same parent) in the BST. Finally, it will delete those nodes that are leaf and doesn't have any sibling and print the tree using preorder traversal.**

**Sample Input: 50 20 70 10 45 80 48**

**Sample Output**

**Pre order traversal: 50 20 10 45 48 70 80**

**The following pairs are siblings:**

**20 and 70**

**20 and 45**

**Pre order traversal after deletion: 10 20 45 50 70 80**

## Problem 3

**Write a program that will delete all negative number by using Pointer. You have to declare a 
pointer array and dynamically allocate memory to input elements of array.**
  
## Problem 4

  **Write a program that will input studentâ€™s information (i.e. name, id, cgpa) who have enrolled for CSE-207 course in Summer 2020. You have to declare a pointer variable to input the 
information and dynamically allocate memory for storing information of each students. After 
taking input find out the student name who has obtained highest cgpa.**
