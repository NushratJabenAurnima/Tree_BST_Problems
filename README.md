## Problem 1
**Write a program to find Largest Number Using Dynamic Memory Allocation from a list of 
elements. You have to input total size of elements and depending upon the number of 
elements, the required size has to be allocated using DMA. 
Example:**

**Input size of array: 5**

**Array element: 1 2 3 4 5**

**Expected Output: 5**

## Problem 2
**Write a program to sort an array using Pointer. You have to write a function sortarray(int n, int * p) where n is the total array size and p is a pointer variable that have array address to solve the problem.**

**Input 5 number of elements in the array: 25 45 89 15 82**

**Expected Output: 15 25 45 82 89**

## Problem 3

**Write a program that will delete all negative number by using Pointer. You have to declare a 
pointer array and dynamically allocate memory to input elements of array.**
  
## Problem 4

  **Write a program that will input studentâ€™s information (i.e. name, id, cgpa) who have enrolled for CSE-207 course in Summer 2020. You have to declare a pointer variable to input the 
information and dynamically allocate memory for storing information of each students. After 
taking input find out the student name who has obtained highest cgpa.**
