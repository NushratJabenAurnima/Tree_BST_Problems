## Problem 1
**Write a program that will display child of each node of a BST (Write only the 
Function).**

**INPUT:**  

 **50**
 
** /**  
**\**
 
 **20 70**
 
** /**  
**\**
 
 **10 45**


**OUTPUT:** 

**Child of 50: 20 and 70**

**Child of 20: 10 and 45**

**Child of 10: NULL**

**Child of 45: NULL**

**Child of 70: NULL**





## Problem 2
**Write a program to sort an array using Pointer. You have to write a function sortarray(int n, int * p) where n is the total array size and p is a pointer variable that have array address to solve the problem.**

**Input 5 number of elements in the array: 25 45 89 15 82**

**Expected Output: 15 25 45 82 89**

## Problem 3

**Write a program that will delete all negative number by using Pointer. You have to declare a 
pointer array and dynamically allocate memory to input elements of array.**
  
## Problem 4

  **Write a program that will input studentâ€™s information (i.e. name, id, cgpa) who have enrolled for CSE-207 course in Summer 2020. You have to declare a pointer variable to input the 
information and dynamically allocate memory for storing information of each students. After 
taking input find out the student name who has obtained highest cgpa.**
